# HashTable
These Java Classes implement Hash Tables with linear and quadratic probing.

These classes were created as a lab for my Data Structures and Algorithms Course. The classes create a hash table data type that stores integers and has hash function h(x) = x % M, where x is the integer being inserted and M is the size of the hash table. HashTableLin implements the hash table using linear probing. HashTableQuad implements the hash table using quadratic probing.
